## Risk-Based Testing Priorities

### Critical Risk Areas (P0)
1. **Statistical Accuracy**: Incorrect statistical results could lead to wrong business decisions
2. **Data Integrity**: Data corruption could invalidate all analyses
3. **Security Vulnerabilities**: Could expose sensitive evaluation data
4. **Performance Degradation**: Could make system unusable under load

### High Risk Areas (P1)
1. **Dashboard Functionality**: Core user interface for analytics consumption
2. **Alert System**: Critical for detecting performance regressions
3. **Integration Points**: Failure could break existing workflows
4. **Real-time Updates**: Essential for monitoring live systems

### Medium Risk Areas (P2)
1. **Advanced Analytics Features**: Nice-to-have but not critical
2. **Export Functionality**: Important but has workarounds
3. **Visualization Options**: Affects usability but not core functionality
4. **Configuration Management**: Important for customization

Remember: This analytics system will be used for critical business decisions about AI model performance. Every statistical result must be mathematically sound and properly validated. Prioritize accuracy over speed, and ensure comprehensive error handling for all edge cases.
